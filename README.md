OAuth1 Application Authentication example for Twitter.

See https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/application-only for more in-depth details

1) To run, you need to set two variables in the script:

``` 
const yourConsumerKey = 'your Twitter consumer key (for this app)';
const yourConsumerSecret = 'and the secret';
```

You can get the key and secret from here https://apps.twitter.com/ (once you made an account and an application).

2) Run it (you need Node + NPM)

```
npm install
node twitter-oauth.js
```
